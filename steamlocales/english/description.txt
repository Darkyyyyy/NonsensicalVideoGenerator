[b]NVG[/b] will then transform your content by picking media at [b]random[/b] and choosing to perform certain actions, all without any form of AI.

You can easily share your [b]rendered results[/b] with your friends or with the community![/p][h2]How could I join the community?[/h2][p]The official [b]Nonsensical Video Generator Discord[/b] community is a place where you can share your creations and download user-submitted media for each of the library categories that [b]NVG[/b] supports. If you need help, the [b]Discord[/b] is the best place to ask for support as well.

You can use built-in templates and upload to the [b]Steam Workshop[/b] directly in-app.[/p][h2]Which kind of media is supported?[/h2][p][b]NVG[/b] supports importing videos and audio clips, categorized by "libraries."
You can import your media into these libraries by default:[/p][list][*][p]Video[/p][list][*][p]Materials: Required, as these videos will be spliced into [b]clips[/b].[/p][/*][*][p]Transitions: These videos are played at their full length in place of a [b]clip[/b].[/p][/*][*][p]Intros & Outros: Show off by adding flair to the start or end of your [b]renders[/b].[/p][/*][*][p]Overlays: Use a green screen background to chroma-key on top of [b]clips[/b].[/p][/*][/list][/*][*][p]Audio[/p][list][*][p]Sound FX: This library is linked to the "Random Sound" [b]effect[/b], which plays one of these sound effects at the same time as a [b]clip[/b].[/p][/*][*][p]Music: This library is linked to the "Dance" [b]effect[/b], which plays this music and makes the [b]clip[/b] play in reverse and forward again, and so on.[/p][/*][*][p]Rave: This library is linked to the "Rave" [b]effect[/b], which plays this music and randomizes the frames of the [b]clip[/b] at high-speed.[/p][/*][*][p]Vocoder: This library is linked to the "Vocoder" [b]effect[/b], which makes the [b]clip[/b]'s original audio turn into one of these vocoder "carriers."[/p][/*][/list][/*][/list][p]Additionally, community-contributed [b]effects[/b] can also create their own video and audio libraries for you to import media into.
Using ".mp4" and ".mp3" media files are recommended, however other formats may be used with possible limitations.
Some [b]effects[/b] on the [b]Workshop[/b] may also download media for you if required.[/p]
